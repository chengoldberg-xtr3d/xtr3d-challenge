# Game
This folder contains two scripts:

1. [algo.py](algo.py) - partial NUI engine class and abstract classes used by it. You need to implement it!
2. [game.py](game.py) - very simple shooter arcade style game to be controlled by the NUI engine. You don't need to touch it. The **data** folder contains resources used by the game script.
